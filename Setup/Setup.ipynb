    "### 2.Installing necessary packages:\n",
    "#### 2.1 On SciServer\n",
    "If you are working on SciServer, the easiest way is to install the `zarr` package to the default conda path. Open a termial and type in the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ conda install -c conda-forge zarr\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A more sophisticated way is to create a separate environment in addition to the default conda distribution. \n",
    "For you convenience, we have wrote a setup script to complete the setup.\n",
    "First, you would need to navigate to this setup folder (/home/idies/workspace/Storage/`<username>`/persistent/LSST_training/Setup/), then execute the following commands (can take up to 10 mins):\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ chmod +x setup.sh\n",
    "$ source setup.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also do it manually following the steps listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Configure the bash shell for conda, open a new terminal and execute:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ echo \". /home/idies/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\" >> ~/.bashrc\n",
    "$ source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Navigate to this folder (/home/idies/workspace/Storage/`<username>`/persistent/LSST_training/Setup/) within your sciserver container to create a new environment (Note that this process can take a while):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ conda env create --file env_sciserver.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Activate the new environment and install the ipython kernel:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ conda activate lsst_train\n",
    "$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name lsst_train --display-name \"LSST_Train\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, refresh the browser tab and a new ipython kernel should appear in the jupyter launcher, if jupyter launcher is not currently open, click the '+' sign above the left sidebar to open it. (See this [screenshot](./figs/launcher.jpg) for an example). "

The screenshots included in the steps below may better explain this process.** \n",

    "1. If you are opening up the existing notebooks for the first time, you could be asked to select a kernel. That is, you will be directed [here](./figs/kernel_window.jpg), then just make sure that the \"LSST_train\" kernel is selected.\n",
    "2. If new softwares need to be installed to this new environment, one needs to make sure this new environment is activated in the current shell (terminal). If the environment is not activated, you can activate it by running `conda activate lsst_train`. \n",
    "3. **\"LSST_train\" environment is NOT automatically activated when you open a new terminal.** Thus, to install new softwares in a new terminal, you should start with `conda activate lsst_train`."
